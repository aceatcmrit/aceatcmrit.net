Day 2 of codeclub

Same 6 turned up... finished the encryption and decrytion thing...
They coudln't accomplish the task in short time when alone, but did it together.

Good thing is that they learnt to detach emotionally from code :p
And learnt something about the beauty of coding from scratch... without any copy paste... 

Bad part, they have classes till 4 tomorrow so they will not be coming...
So we're not expecting anyone tomorrow...

And ya we were on #cmrcodeclub but not much happened on the channel...
