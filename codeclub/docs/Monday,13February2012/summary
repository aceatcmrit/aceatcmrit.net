Day 1 of codeclub
Went pretty well I'd say...
Six turned up and we ended up spending a lot of our project time helping them :)
But maybe it was worth it.

Good thing is that we idled on #cmrcodeclub on irc.freenode.net...
They also installed synapse/Do and learnt how to use the software centre...
Workspaces... was a surprise they din use them...
Also installed gedit-plugins for good coding practices

C file operations might have been new to them...
My opinion was that a couple of them could cut it...
Others struggled a bit... Many days of continuous coding should fix that...
