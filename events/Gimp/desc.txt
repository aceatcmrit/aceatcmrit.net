<FONT SIZE=3><B>Event Results:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>	The two day
hands on workshop went very well as the students got the opportunity
to sit and actually work out the things rather than listening to the
seminars. It was lot more interactive with Srihari approaching 
individual table regularly throughout the seminar. The results were
positive with the students demanding more of such interactive
sessions in future. </FONT>
